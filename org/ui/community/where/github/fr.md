[L'organisation `freesewing` sur Github](https://github.com/freesewing/) contient tous nos r√©pertoires et code source.

We don't only use Github for development, but also use Github issues for (lightweight) project management and discussion of feature request and bugs.

It's also where you'll find the notes and agenda of our [contributor calls](/community/calls/).
