###### Discord

We use [chat on Discord](https://chat.freesewing.org/) to organize ourselves

###### Facebook

We have [a FreeSewing Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/627769821272714) that you should join. Not that the group is private, so you should request access, but that's merely to keep the bots and trolls at bay.

###### Github

[The `freesewing` organisation on Github](https://github.com/freesewing/) holds all our repositories and source code.

We don't only use Github for development, but also use Github issues for (lightweight) project management.


###### Instagram

Our Instagram account is [@freesewing_org](https://instagram.com/freesewing_org).  
Follow us for updates on new pattern releases, makes from the community, and other news.

###### Reddit

You can turn to [r/freesewing](https://www.reddit.com/r/freesewing/) on Reddit were you'll find people from the community hanging out.

###### Twitter

Our Twitter account is [@freesewing_org](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org). Follow us for updates on new pattern releases, makes from the community, and other news.

###### YouTube
