## About our patterns

##### Made to your measurements

All our patterns are *made-to-measure*. 
Not just graded up or down, but actually drafted to your exact specifications, just as you would on paper.

##### Packed with options plus live preview

FreeSewing patterns come with options that allow you to customize different aspects of the pattern. 
Our live preview means no surprises: what you see is what you get.

##### Patterns you can share and adapt

FreeSewing patterns often have so many options that one pattern can yield a variety of styles.
You can share your patterns with others so they can get the same style, drafted to their measurements.
