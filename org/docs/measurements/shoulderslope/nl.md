The **shoulder slope** measurement is an indicator for the amount with which your shoulder slopes downward.

To measure your shoulder slope, measure from the center of your back at the hipline to the tip of your shoulder.

<Note>

This measurement will be combined with [the HPS to hips back measurement](/docs/measurements/hpstohipsback/) to determine the slope of your shoulders.
