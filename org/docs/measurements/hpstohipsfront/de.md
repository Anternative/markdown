title: HPS to hips front

<Note>

###### HPS: high point shoulder

The *high point shoulder* or *HPS* point is used as the base for several vertical measurements.
Refer to [the hps documentation](/docs/measurements/hps/) for information on how to locate this point.

</Note>

The **high point shoulder (HPS) to hips front** measurement runs from your HPS down to your hipline across the front of your body.

Tp measure your HPS to hips front, first [localize your HPS point](/docs/measurements/hps/). Then measure straight down to your hipline, which is the line between the top of your hip bones, across the front of your body.

The point of this measurement is to measure the length of your torso, and specifically how much it differs from the back (where there's no breasts to go around).
