title: With or without breasts?
order: 250
---

Some people get confused by the terms **with breasts** and **without breasts**.

We use these terms as a gender-neutral way to ask whether a person has breasts yes or no. If it makes it easier for you, you can simply see it like this:

 - **With breasts**: Woman or womenswear
 - **Without breasts**: Man or menswear

<Note>

##### Why we ask in the first place

Fitting a chest with breasts is more complex than fitting a chest without breasts. 
There are extra measurements and options required, and we want to display these
only when it's relevant.
