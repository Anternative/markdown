## About FreeSewing

### Kann ich FreeSewing für kommerzielle Zwecke verwenden?

Ja, das kannst du. Open Source ist ein Entwicklungsmodell und kein Geschäftsmodell.

Wenn unsere Arbeit Ihnen helfen kann, Essen auf den Tisch zu bringen, zögern Sie nicht sie dazu zu verwenden.

### Was ist euer Endziel?

Wir möchten, dass freesewing.org die WikiPedia der Schnittmuster wird.

We are not interested in fashion, trends, or publishing the hot new pattern of the season. Instead, we want to empower makers by distilling the knowledge of the sewing community into patterns and documentation and make that information globally available.

### Wer zahlt für all das?

Das FreeSewing-Projekt wird von [unseren Patrons](/patrons) finanziell unterstützt.

Patrons are regular users like you who agreed to make a small monthly contribution to keep freesewing going.

<Note>

## Accounts & Privacy

### How can I sign up? I never received the E-mail to activate my account!

If you did not receive the email, check your spam/junk folder. If you can't find it there either, it is most likely that your E-mail provider blocked it outright.

Either try using a different E-mail address, or [reach out to us](https://chat.freesewing.org/) so we can help you activate your account.

<Note>

##### Users in France are more likely to run into this problem

In in France, several E-mail provider share the same filtering:

 - free.fr
 - laposte.net
 - organge.fr
 - sfr.fr

They are all known to cause issues with deliveries.

</Note>

### Why do I need to create an account to download a made-to-measure pattern?

For practical reasons. To generate made-to-measure sewing patterns, we need your measurements.

Asking for them every time would be rather tedious, so we need to store this information. And your account is where we do that.

Without a way to store your measurements, generating made-to-measure patterns would be hopelessly inpractical.

<Note>

##### Are you asking because you don't trust us?

This question often hints at an underlying distrust towards
creating an account. As such, the following questions and answers may also be relevant:

 - [What are you doing with my personal data?](#what-are-you-doing-with-my-personal-data)
 - [Who pays for all of this?](#who-pays-for-all-of-this)
 - [What's your end game?](#whats-your-end-game)

</Note>

### What are you doing with my personal data?

How we handle your personal data is documented in [our privacy notice](/docs/about/privacy/).



## Sewing patterns

### I know my size, but your pattern doesn't fit me

The standard sizes we offer are there to allow you to discover our platform without the need to create an account. We advice against using them as-is.

Drafting made-to-measure sewing patterns really is *our thing*. If you insist on getting a pattern in a standard size, FreeSewing is not for you.

Thankfully, Fiona curates [a list of indie pattern designers](https://chainstitcher.blogspot.com/p/indie-pattern-designers.html) , so you have plenty of alternatives.

### Why don't you use double notches to mark the back of the pattern?

A double-notch is a common way to mark the back of the pattern. Common, but not universal.

Different parts of the world have different conventions or tradidions on how to notch patterns. To avoid confusion, we use a differently styled notch to indicate the back, as detailed in [our pattern notation legend](/docs/about/patterns/notation/).
