## Seams

Seams (the lines on which you sew) are indicated by a solid line. The color of the line indicates the fabric type of the pattern piece:

<Legend part="fabricLines" caption="Seamlines for different fabric types" >

## Seam allowance

Seam allowance is indicated by a dashed line, that has the same width and color as the seam they belong to:

<Legend part="saLines" caption="Seam allowance for different fabric types" >

Note that the corners of the seam allowance are trimmed, and not extended:

<Legend part="sa" caption="A trimmer seam allowance corner" >

## Other lines

Some patterns may have other lines on them, there are 4 additional styles:

 - Note
 - Mark
 - Contrast
 - Help

They might be used by patterns designers to add additional info, depending on the context.

<Legend part="otherLines" caption="Other line styles" >

## Grainline and cut-on-fold indicator

Grainlines — a line that indicates the *fabric grain* — look like this:

<Legend part="grainline" caption="A grainline indicator" >

Cut-on-fold indicators look similar, but point towards the line on which the fabric should be folded:

<Legend part="cutonfold" caption="A cut-on-fold indicator" >

## Notches

There are two types of notches. The default notch is a blue dot in a blue circle.

An alternative style shows a red cross in a red circle. This style is used to indicate the back of a garment. For example, on a sleevecap you may see a blue and a red notch. This way you know which side of the sleevecap is the front (the one with the blue notch).

<Legend part="notches" caption="The default notch style (shown left) and alternative style for notches on the back" >

<Tip>

**Why we chose these notches**

In electromagnetism, a ⊙ symbol is used to indicate a flow of current coming towards you (to the front),
whereas ⊗  is used for a current moving away from you (to the back).

You can also think of an arrow. When an arrow flies towards you, you see its tip (⊙).
When an arrow flies away from you, you see its fletches (⊗).

## Buttons, buttonholes, and snaps

Buttons and buttonholes may come in different sizes, but always have the same shaped that represents how they look like in real life:

<Legend part="buttons" caption="A button is shown on the left, and a buttonhole on the right" >

Snaps have a *stud* and *socket* part, and also look like the real thing:

<Legend part="snaps" caption="A snap stud is shown on the left, and a snap socket on the right" >

## Dimensions

When you opt for a *paperless* pattern, your pattern will come with dimensions:

<Legend part="dimension" caption="An example of a dimension on a pattern" >

<Note>

###### Pay close attention to dimension on (non paperless) patterns

Some patterns use dimension to indicate the full size of a pattern piece.
This typically happens when a part is a mere rectangle and printing, as a way to save paper.

So when a pattern includes a dimension, make sure to pay attention to it.
</Note>

## Scale box

The scale box allows you to verify that your pattern was printed to the correct scale:

<Legend part="scalebox" caption="The scale box" >

<Tip>
To verify the printed size, you can first only print the page that has the scale box on it.
</Tip>

## Title

Each pattern piece has a title that tells you the number and name of the piece, as well as the pattern name:

<Legend part="title" caption="Example of a title" >

<Note>
When you generate a pattern on freesewing.org, the title will also include the name of the person the pattern was made for.
</Note>

## Logo

Some (or all) pattern pieces may also include the FreeSewing logo. The logo has no special meaning, it's just branding.

<Legend part="logo" caption="The FreeSewing logo" >

## Lines widths and strokes

Designers can, if they so choose, override the default line widths or set a specific stroke. They might do that to add additional info, like where to fold a pattern, or the outline of where a pocket would go.

For reference, here are the different available line widths:

<Legend part="lineWidths" caption="The different line widths" >

And these are the different stroke styles:

<Legend part="lineStrokes" caption="The different line strokes" >
