title: Your measurements
---

Taking accurate measurements is crucial for good results with our patterns, yet not as trivial as you would think.

We've added a few indicators to help you spot mistakes or problems in your measurements. 

 - Your models show [a graphical representation of your body measurements](/docs/about/your-measurements/model-graph), which will allow you to spot any outliers.
 - We include [estimates for your different measurements](/docs/about/your-measurements/estimates), and highlight those measurements where your model differs significantly from the estimage.

###### Caveat: Work in progress

This is a very new feature, and we are still working out the details. The further you deviate from
the neck circumference our predictions are based on (42cm for models without breasts, 36cm for models
with breasts) the more likely it is that the projections aren't hitting home.

###### Breasts are tricky

Particularly for models with breasts, we are aware that there's some fine-tuning yet to be done.
