![The horizontal stretch factor option on Bruce](./horizontalstretchfactor.svg)

Deze optie staat je toe rekening te houden met de hoeveelheid stretch in de stof die je gebruikt.

If you choose 90& (for example) for every 10cm of fabric, we'll only draft 9cm. This way, 9cm of fabric will be stretched to 10cm, which is why we call that a 90% stretch factor.

> If you're not sure what to pick, best is to take the fabric you are going to make your top out and see how much fabric you need to stretch out to get to 10 cm with a *good* stretch.
