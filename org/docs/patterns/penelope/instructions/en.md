## What you need

To make Penelope, you will need the following:

  - Basic sewing supplies
  - About 1 meter of a suitable fabric 
  - A hidden zipper
  - Some interfacing for the waistband (if used) and maybe for the vent and hem
  - Some sort of closure for the waistband (if used)
  - Optionally: lining fabric

## Notes and tips

### Lining

Pencil skirts are tight. This limits your movement quite a bit. More so, when you 
try to sit down, the skirt may try to pull itself off your waist, or, when you get 
back up, stay quite high on your bum. Lining the skirt will make it move a lot
easier around your curves, and thereby make it easier for you to move. 

Adding lining can be done by creating a slightly shorter front and back piece, that 
have some extra fabric in the middle. The extra fabric makes it easier for the 
lining to move. One inch for each of the front and back pieces is enough. You can
either make a box pleat in the front and back, or add the extra fabric where the
darts are. You do not need to sew darts in the lining fabric. Just a pleat at the
dart position will be fine.

### Waistband

A waist band is optional on Penelope. If you omit it, there will be quite some stress
on the top of the zipper. Make sure your zipper is up to the task. 

### Zipper

Without the zipper it will be impossible to get in and out of the skirt. So it should
be at least the length from your waist to the largest part of your bum. Longer will
make it easier to put the skirt on and off. Don't use one that's too long, because the
part of the seam where the zipper is behaves differently than the part without it, and
you want to try to make it invissible also in movement.

Traditionally, a hidden zipper is used in a pencil skirt. Lately there has been a trend 
to use zippers that are right in the open. Sometimes even from contrasting fabric. 
Choose what works for you in the style you're going for. Be creative (or not)!

### Vent

A vent in the back is optional with Penelope. It will allow you to walk a lot easier 
than if you make the skirt without it. The vent also influences where the zipper will 
be located. If you choose to have no vent, the default zipper location is on the side
seam, and the back will be cut-on-fold. With the vent, there has to be a seam in the 
back piece, and the zipper will be located on that seam.

### Darts

Darts are used to compensate for the difference between your waist and seat measurements.
Depending on this difference, there can be two darts, one dart, or no darts at all. More
darts make for a potentially better fit. But if the amount of fabric that the dart will
take in becomes too small, the number of darts will be reduced. Otherwise it would be 
very difficult to sew the darts, and they would probably become rather unsightly. Some 
of the difference will be taken in by the side seam, and if the difference is small, no 
darts will be included in the front and back pieces.

## Cutting

Penelope consists of a front and a back piece. The front piece is always cut-on-fold. For
the back piece, this depends on whether you wanted a vent, or moved the zipper to the back
seam. Either of those options will have you cut out two individual pieces for the back. 
When you cut out a piece on the fold, remember that the fold does not need to be in the 
middle of the fabric. Choosing the placement of your pieces wisely can greatly reduce the
amount of fabric you need for your skirt.

## Construction

We're not going into a full explanation here on how to create all the individual details 
that make up a pencil skirt. We assume that you know how to sew a dart, insert an invisible 
zipper, make a vent, etc. If not, there are numerous excellent articles available on the 
web, both in writen form, and on video. If you do get stuck, you can always reach out to 
[other Freesewers](https://gitter.im/freesewing/help).

First, sew all the darts. You want to press them towards the back. So for the back piece, 
that means you press boths sides towards eachother. For the front piece, just the opposite.

The next thing you want to do is sew the seam that has the zipper, and insert the zipper 
into it. Follow the procedure that is appropriate for the type of zipper you're using.

Your next step depends on whether you have a vent and lining.
