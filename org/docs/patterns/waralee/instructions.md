## What you need

To make Waralee, you will need the following:

  - Basic sewing supplies
  - About 2 meters of a suitable fabric 
  - Some interfacing for the waistband 

## Notes and tips

### Fabric

This is a type of wrap pants, which leaves the sides of your legs exposed at times. And as 
such, it is mostly worn in warmer weather, or inside. To get a good effect of the flowing
of the legs, don't use very heavy materials. Good types of fabric are linen, and linen blends.
These mostly have a nice drape and are cool. Heavy materials like denim are less useful. 

### Waist band

Waralee is in some sense just a waist band with a long piece of fabric attached. The waist 
band needs to continue from the fabric into two strands of fabric that are used to tie the
pants in the front and back. These strands are not included in the pattern. Traditionally,
they are of similar length. You can make longer ones for the back panel, to allow you to 
tie both sets in the front. I prefer this as it is easier to do, and you don't have the bulk 
of the knot in the back.

### Pockets

Traditionally, these types of pants do not have pockets. But I want to put my phone, keys 
and wallet somewhere. So I've included pockets in the pattern. You can decide for yourself 
if you would like them.

## Cutting

Waralee consists of two identical pieces of fabric. They are basically big rectangles with 
pieces missing. As such, it is easier to print out the piece you need to cut out and 
measure the rest, than it is to print out everything and cut the pattern the traditional
way.

The pattern is available both ways. You can print out the whole thing, tape all the pages
together, and use that to cut out the fabric. It is also possible to print out only the 
part that you need to cut out. This part has a *negative* seam allowance, since you'll 
be using it opposite of what you normally use the pattern pieces for. 

If you opt for the cut-out method, use the *paperless* view to see all the dimensions
of the pattern. You will need to cut a narrow rectangle out from what will become the 
front, and a small triangle and rectangle from what will become the back. And in the 
middle between these will be the little cut-out pattern piece. Make sure you measure 
this correctly, and you have the fabric squared before you start cutting.

## Construction

The construction of Waralee is very simple. It consists of these steps:

- Sew the pockets
- Sew (hem) the sides
- Hem the bottom
- Sew the two parts together at the crotch
- Sew the four strands
- Sew the waist band

### Pockets

These are optional. I included placements for the front pockets that will be hidden by
the flaps in the front. But they will still be easily accessible to put your phone or 
keys in. These are single welt pockets. The ones in the front are at an angle and the 
ones in the back are horizontally oriented. The pocket templates should allow for enough 
fabric to attach the pocket to the waistband. If you want particularly deep pockets, 
please adjust accordingly.

### Sides and bottom

The sides and bottom need to be hemmed. You can use whatever method works best for you.
In the version I first made I just serged the sides, folded them back and top stitched 
them. I did this to keep the bulk of the fabric to a minimum and allow for a better 
drape. What you do should depend on the type of fabric you're using.

We're not going into a full explanation here on how to create all the individual details 
that make up a pencil skirt. We assume that you know how to sew a dart, insert an invisible 
zipper, make a vent, etc. If not, there are numerous excellent articles available on the 
web, both in writen form, and on video. If you do get stuck, you can always reach out to 
[other Freesewers](https://gitter.im/freesewing/help).

First, sew all the darts. You want to press them towards the back. So for the back piece, 
that means you press boths sides towards eachother. For the front piece, just the opposite.

The next thing you want to do is sew the seam that has the zipper, and insert the zipper 
into it. Follow the procedure that is appropriate for the type of zipper you're using.

Sew up both the side seams.

Your next step depends on whether you have a vent and lining. If you're including a lining,
now is the time to make it. The lining is made the same way that the rest of the skirt is 
made, with two exceptions; the darts are just pleats, and they have more 'ease' included. 
How you distribute this 'ease' is up to you. You can add it to the dart pleats, add another 
dart pleat, or make a box pleat in the middle. 

Of course, if you include a lining, you have to include this in the way you've finished 
your zipper. And connect it to the vent, if your skirt has one of those.

Next is attaching the waistband if your version has one. First fold it double along the 
long side and press. Add your interfacing. Sew it to the right side of the fabric. Then 
turn it over and press the seam into the waistband. Now use the stitch-in-the-ditch 
technique to finish the waistband. Add your choice of closure.

All that is left now is to hem the skirt.
