## Bent est un bloc, pas un patron

Un bloc est une forme de base sur laquelle d'autres patron sont basÃ©s. They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Point is, there is no point in providing instructions on how to make Bent.

That's because Bent is not supposed to be made as-is, but rather can serve as the basis for your own pattern designs.

> Some of the patterns based on Bent include [Carlton](/patterns/carlton), [Carlita](/patterns/carlita), and [Jaeger](/patterns/jaeger).
