Combien d'aisance aux tÃªtes de manches voulez-vous ?

> #### ###### Pour quoi faire ?
> 
> The amount of sleevecap ease determines how the sleeves rolls from the shoulder.
> 
> More ease makes the sleeve curl into the seam as you would expect from a coat. Less ease makes the sleeve lie flatter.

> The lighter your fabric, the less sleevecap ease you want.
