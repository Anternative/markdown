How much do you want the sleeve to be wider than your upperarm circumference?

> We will try to respect your choice here, but out priority is to fit the sleeve in the armhole.
> 
> #### Waarom?
> 
> It's actually men with big arms who prefer a tighter fit, and thus less ease here. That's because it draws attention to their strong upper arms.
> 
> If your upper arms are more skinny, you'll want some more ease here to smooth things out a bit.
