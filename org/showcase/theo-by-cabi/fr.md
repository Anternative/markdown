This is a adaption of the Theo pattern. I left out the zipper and the buttons. Instead of this I filled the waistband with a elastic.

The intention of this trousers were to have a nice sloppy trousers at home. But with the linen fabric and its colour the trousers still hold the classic chic of the pattern. Now I wear them at work and funsies.
