Salut tout le monde, c'est Joost. J'√©cris ce message pour aborder certains probl√®mes qui m'ont ennuy√© ces derniers temps. Notamment :

 - Probl√®me 1 : [Il y a trop de travail](#problem-1-there-is-too-much-work)
 - Probl√®me 2 : [J'ai l'impression de perdre contact avec la communaut√©](#problem-2-i-feel-im-losing-track-of-the-community)
 - Probl√®me 3 : [je ne me sens pas √† l'aise sur la mani√®re de traiter les probl√®mes de racisme](#problem-3-i-feel-insecure-about-how-to-deal-with-the-issue-of-systemic-racism)

La bonne nouvelle est que la liste est courte. Et nouvelle encore meilleure, la solution √† ces probl√®mes est la m√™me : [ le community building (construction d'une communaut√©)](#community-building)

Avant d'entrer dans le vif du sujet, examinons bri√®vement chaque probl√®me :

## Probl√®me 1 : il y a trop de travail

Au cours de la semaine derni√®re, j'ai lu [Travailler en public](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/) un livre sur *La cr√©ation et la maintenance de logiciels open source* par [Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/).

Je l'ai achet√© en esp√©rant y trouver des r√©ponses √† certaines des questions que je me pose. Comme *Comment font les autres ?* ou *Suis-je en train de me tromper ?*

En d'autres termes, j''esp√©rais trouver une solution √† ce qui est pour moi un probl√®me grandissant : l''incapacit√© √† dimensionner mon propre travail √† la fa√ßon dont je voudrais dimensionner le projet FreeSewing.

Sans vouloir trop le critiquer, ce livre ne m'a fourni aucune r√©ponse concr√®te sur la mani√®re de r√©soudre ce probl√®me. Il s'av√®re que la grande majorit√© des mainteneurs open source sont dans le m√™me bateau. La plupart des projets sont maintenus par une seule personne ou  une poign√©e de personnes.

Et il n'y a rien de mal √† cela. Mais cela implique que ce que peut accomplir FreeSewing a des liimites.

## Probl√®me 2 : J'ai l'impression de perdre contact avec la communaut√©

Je regrette d'avoir n√©glig√© les aspects communautaires de FreeSewing. Il n'y a pas de commentaires ou d'aspects *sociaux* sur le site. J'ai toujours pens√© que c'√©tait une erreur d'essayer de r√©unir les gens sur votre propre site Web, et qu'il vallait mieux les laisser discuter sur les plates-formes de leur choix.

Pour la communaut√© couture, c'est souvent Instagram. Or comme j'ai quitt√© Instagram il y a un an, j'ai l'impression de m'√©loigner de la communaut√©.

Mes [raisons de quitter](https://joost.decock.org/post/187710847164/24-hours-from-now-i-want-to-remove-my-instagram) sont les m√™mes aujourd'hui qu'√† l'√©poque, mais j'aimerais pouvoir me connecter avec la communaut√© d'une mani√®re qui fonctionne pour moi.

## Probl√®me 3: Je ne me sens pas √† l'aise sur la mani√®re de traiter les probl√®mes de racisme.

Premi√®rement : **Black lives matter**‚úäüèæ

Mon malaise vient de mon environnement. Je suis un homme blanc cis-genre d'√¢ge moyen, n√© et √©lev√© dans un pays dont l'histoire est teint√©e du sang de gens de couleur ([ce pays est la Belgique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State)). √Ä ce jour, un racisme occasionnel impr√®gne tous les aspects de la soci√©t√© dans laquelle je vis.

La diversit√© d'une communaut√© est *une condition sine qua non* pour moi. Mais je ne sais pas vraiment comment proc√©der.

## Community building

As I mentioned earlier, these things have been on my mind for a while, albeit a lot more fuzzy. Then earlier this month I listened to [Episode 156 of the Love to Sew podcast: Black makers matter with Julian Collins](https://lovetosewpodcast.com/episodes/episode-156-black-makers-matter-with-julian-collins/).

[Julian](https://www.instagram.com/juliancreates/) is a patron of FreeSewing (thanks Julian) and actively involved with the [Black makers matter](https://www.instagram.com/blkmakersmatter/) movement on Instagram. I reached out to Julian looking for help, and we had a lengthy Zoom call where we talked about his work and how he goes about organizing the community.

Julian had a lot of good advice. And I couldn't possibly cram it all into this post, but it sort of boils down to:

 - Just ask people for help
 - Be clear about what kind of community you want to build

So I am taking Julian's advice to heart, and I am asking for help. Before we get to that, let's make sure we're all on the same page about the kind of community we're trying to build here.

## Quick check: Are you on board with FreeSewing's values?

To ensure that your values are aligned with those of FreeSewing, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with:

 - [Our community standards](/docs/about/community-standards/)
 - [Our code of conduct](https://freesewing.dev/guides/code-of-conduct/)
 - [Our revenue pledge](/docs/about/pledge/)

Assuming that reading that made you happy rather than angry, we could use your help :)

## Aidez √† faire grandir FreeSewing au-del√† de ce que je peux faire seul

We are starting simple: We plan to hold a Zoom/Skype/Whatever call every 2 weeks to figure it out as we go. We start the first weekend of September (next weekend). We haven't picked a time yet, for it will depend on the time zones the participants live in.

If you'd like to attend, please [let us know in our chat room](https://chat.freesewing.org/).

### What kind of help is needed?

Beggars can't be choosers. All help is welcome, and I certainly don't want to turn down any offers of assistance.

At the same time, I feel it's important to say that FreeSewing is not a commercial entity. Nor will it ever be. These are not job offers. They are a call for help to volunteers who are happy to lend a hand when they can.

That being said, an overly vague call defuses the message. So I have written down a number of *roles* below to give you an idea of the kind of work that goes into FreeSewing. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but merely a starting point for a discussion.

The order is alphabetic.

**Backend Developer**  
You keep our backend in step with the latest frontend developments. Express is no stranger to you. Node JS is a good friend. Or maybe you'd like them to be.

**Body Ambassador**  
Maybe you're unusually short or tall. Maybe you have a bit of a pot belly or very large breasts. Maybe you have a disability that requires fit adjustments. Whatever it is, you represent a minority of fitting issues, and are willing to act as an ambassador to make sure your needs or heard and understood.

**Community Builder**  
You're an extrovert extraordinaire, or at least good at faking it. You enjoy chatting with all sorts of people, and networking is just you doing you. You're like the jelly that molds a group of individuals into a cohesive community.

**Database Administrator**  
You look after our database. Other people might feel that's not important, but you know better. You're familiar with MongoDB.

**Devops Engineer**  
Your aim is to make almost all these other roles irrelevant by automating the heck out of everything. CI and Github actions are fun for you. You like to sit back and have the robots do the work for you.

**Frontend Developer**  
You work on freesewing.org or freesewing.dev. React is your jam, or maybe you'd like it to be.

**Illustrator**  
You create illustrations to go alongside the written documentation.  When you draw a bicycle from memory, it actually looks like a bicycle.

**Inclusion & Diversity Manager**  
You have skin in the game when it comes to inclusion and diversity. You'll help make our community welcoming and diverse. You're not afraid to tell this pasty white dude when he's wrong.

**Language Ambassador**  
You represent FreeSewing in a non-English community. You can help answer questions of triage problem reports. Or you can point out where translations are missing.

**Pattern Ambassador**  
You'll be responsible for a FreeSewing design/pattern. You'll be *the person* to ask questions about how to make said pattern. You'll make sure the documentation is not forgotten. And you can help with questions or triage problem reports to developers or designers.

**Pattern Designer**  
You come up with new pattern designs for FreeSewing. You might not know how to turn on a computer, but damn if you can't draft a bodice.

**Pattern Developer**  
You program new designs for FreeSewing. You might not know how to design sewing patterns, but you're not afraid of Javascript and are happy to team up with a designer to work on a new pattern together.

**Proofreader**  
You check original English text of translations for typos and/or grammar mistakes. You propose improvements and watch over a consistent style and tone across FreeSewing's documentation and written text. You're fluent in the language you're proofreading.

**Social Media Platform Manager**  
You represent FreeSewing on a *platform* where platform can be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, Reddit, &hellip;. You manage the FreeSewing account on the platform, and use it to interact with the community.

**System Administrator** You look after our servers. Install updates, make sure certificates are up-to-date, the works. Linux is where your heart lies. You secretly automated most of your work with Ansible but hey, you put the playbooks in git so no worries.

**Technical Writer (code)**  
You write documentation for freesewing.dev, our developers website. You have good writing skills and familiarity with code (Javascript).

**Technical Writer (sewing)**  
You write documentation for freesewing.org, our makers website. You have good writing skills and are familiarity with sewing.

**Translator**  
You translate into one of FreeSewing's additional languages (French, German, Dutch, Spanish) or if you're ambitious, add a new one. You're fluent in the language you're translating to, and have a good grasp of English.

**UX Designer**  
You know what UX is and are happy to point out where it sucks and how it can be made better.

**Release Manager**  
You pull the plug on new releases, you bundle our code, and publish new versions of our packages on NPM.

**Web Designer**  
You know how to make things pretty, even if you're not sure how to actually make them work.  You appreciate that we don't use #000 for black.

### What's in it for me

We can't offer you money. Please [read our revenue pledge](/docs/about/pledge/) to understand why that is.

What we can offer is responsibility, recognition, and a stake in something that strives to be a force for good in this world.

It can also be an excellent learning opportunity for those of you who would like to pivot to a role in web development. And for as far as my time stretches ‚Äî I will gladly teach and mentor people from underprivileged communities aiming for social mobility.

## Conclusion

Maybe you can help. Maybe you know somebody who can help, or for whom this would be a valuable learning experience.

Either way, I'd appreciate it if you could help spread the message. And that message is that I'm asking for help.

Thank you  
joost
