**TL;DR: Please make facemasks for healthcare workers**


 - PDF pattern for our Fu face mask:
   - [A4 facemask pattern](/fu-facemask-freesewing.org.a4.pdf)
   - [Letter facemask pattern](/fu-facemask-freesewing.org.letter.pdf)
 - [Instructions for the facemask pattern](/docs/patterns/fu/instructions/)

Well that escalated quickly. We published [our Fu Face Mask pattern](/designs/fu/) at the end of last month, hoping it would be helpful. Now, [hospitals are actively reaching out to people to beg them to make fabric face masks for their staff](https://www.uza.be/mondmaskers).

So obviously, we want to help:

 - PDF pattern for our Fu face mask:
   - [A4 facemask pattern](/fu-facemask-freesewing.org.a4.pdf)
   - [Letter facemask pattern](/fu-facemask-freesewing.org.letter.pdf)
 - [Instructions for the facemask pattern](/docs/patterns/fu/instructions/)

No go and make a bunch. Our healthcare workers are counting on you!
