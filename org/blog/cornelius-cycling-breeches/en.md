[Wouter](https://www.instagram.com/wouter.vdub/) is at it again, this time around he's treating us to classic cycling breeches.

This pattern is based on the Keystone drafting method.
Not that it matters because as always you get it made-to-measure for 
you [right here on FreeSewing.org](/designs/cornelius/).

Note that you don't have to cycle to wear these. 
All that's required is a willingness to show of those socks (or calfs).

Cornelius is available at [/designs/cornelius/](/designs/cornelius/).
