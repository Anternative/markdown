# Pattern releases winter 2021

Here's a quick recap of the new patterns we released in the first quarter of this year:

 - [The Bella bodice block for womenswear](https://freesewing.org/blog/bella-bodice-block/): A collaboration with somebody from the industry to replicate the kind of bodice block that's used in fashion today. Currently it has a bust dart towards the side-seam. A variation with a shoulder dart is on our todo list.
 - [The Hortensia handbag](https://freesewing.org/blog/announcing-hortensia/): Another collaboration, this time between Stofsuchti and long-time contributor Wouter Van Wageningen brought the first handbag pattern to FreeSewing.
 - [The Cornelius cycling breeches](https://freesewing.org/blog/cornelius-cycling-breeches/): More from Wouter still, these cycling breeches or knickerbockers are based on the Keystone drafting method.

# Behind the seams: Wouter Van Wageningen

> With two pattern releases to his name in the last 3 months, 
> who better to shine a spotlight on than long time contributor Wouter.
>
> One of our more recent contributors An interviewed him for this newsletter:

## Bio

Born in the Netherlands and lived there for 30 years before moving to “the States”. 
He accompanied his American wife at that time when she wanted to return. 
At this moment, he has been living there for about 20 years and still remembers the Netherlands as his former home. 

As a busy IT manager, he still manages to create a new pattern from time to time.

## How did you learn about freesewing?

Many years ago, I was looking for patterns for men. 
The site of Joost, back then Makemypattern (since late 2012), came up my search results and it had an interesting concept.

## How did you become a contributor?

At the beginning, there were no contributors or at least not that I remember, 
but I am the first non-Joost pattern holder since freesewing. 
I wanted to test the tools that Joost created which were originally created in the PHP programming language. 
Although, I am a programmer, either employed or as a hobby, I had never worked with this language before. 
Nevertheless, I thought it was an interesting challenge to contribute to the work of Joost. 

As this was my first experience with the toolset, the language and pattern making, 
I picked something easy as a bow tie (https://freesewing.org/designs/benjamin/). 
It is a simple object as it is a flat “thing” that has a width and a height, but no real depth. 
Therefore, I didn’t have to try to form a piece of fabric around a 3D shape.

As I did draw a pencil skirt before by just using measurements from a partner, 
I realized whilst working on the bow tie, I could do the same thing for this skirt. 
Thus, the Penelope pencil skirt (https://freesewing.org/designs/penelope/) was born.

## What has been your contributor work so far?

Afterwards, I created the Waralee wrap pants (https://freesewing.org/designs/waralee/), 
Albert apron (https://freesewing.org/designs/albert/) and Cornelius cycling breeches (https://freesewing.org/designs/cornelius/). 
Additionally, I also did the implementation of the Hortensia handbag (https://freesewing.org/designs/hortensia/), but that is not my design. 
I got the drawings and measurements from the designer. Whilst, the Benjamin bow tie was totally my own creation as I imagined how it should look like. 
The Penelope and Waralee designs, on the other hand, were built from the knowledge I gathered by reading about those types of garments. 
The Cornelius is actually an implementation of another existing drafting system.

## When and why did you start sewing?

Seven or eight years ago, I wanted to know what it would be like to wear a kilt. 
Kilts are insanely expensive because they are made of very nice wool and it takes an enormous amount of time to actually make a real Scottish kilt. 
In response, there are these “utility kilts” which are basically a cargo pair of pants made in that fashion. 
Although, they are crafted out of cotton and have practical pockets, they still cost around $200. 

Because, I was still figuring out whether I could wear or even enjoy wearing a kilt, it didn't make much sense to me to invest that much. 
So, I found a website dedicated to people wearing kilts and a description on how to create your own utility kilt.
And as I did have a sewing machine, I bought some fabrics and started sewing. 
One became two and then, I also needed a shirt to go along with it and it should be somewhat contemporary to what I’m doing. 
Hence, I found a pattern to make that shirt. That led to making more and more shirts, and then pants and... 

At one point, I decided I'm not going to buy anymore clothes, I'm just going to make them. 
The first exceptions to that new rule are underwear and socks as these don’t give me the pleasure in making them and are usually so ridiculously cheap. 
The second are athletic clothing as I just cannot buy the fabrics (e.g. eVent) you need for it. 
These are exclusively sold to vendors of these types of clothing.

## What is your daily job, outside of freesewing?

IT manager, I take care of the IT means for a union of homecare workers.

## What are you currently working on?

Nothing at the moment, but I am looking into the possibility to make a pattern based on the trouser block. 
That way, I do not have to start from scratch as I usually do, but I can start from Joosts work. 
I am looking forward to trying this technique whilst creating a pair of pants.

## Which project did you just finish?

The Cornelius cycling breeches (https://freesewing.org/designs/cornelius/) and the implementation of the Hortensia handbag (https://freesewing.org/designs/hortensia/).

## What sewing project are you most proud of?

A lot of projects, my first shirt, even though it has a lot of problems, my first tailored coat, all of my art shirts, … 
But if I had to pick one, it would probably be my Mondrian shirt. It was the one where I went all the way from a concept in my mind to creating it on paper to turning it into a garment.

## What in your life are you most proud of?

The non-trivial thing I'm proud of because I did it is to the extent that I was a volunteer firefighter for about 10 years. 
Additionally, for the last 20 years or so, I've worked for nonprofits trying to make the world a better place.

## What do you love the most about sewing?

The creativity. I like to make things and with sewing, in contrast to woodworking, 
I discovered that I can be really precise and I can bring out the patience in myself to do that precision. 
What’s more, if my assumptions are not correct, I can usually undo it (e.g. take the seam out). 
On the other hand, I can make something that is a flat drawing on a piece of paper to something that is turned 
into a real 3D real thing by putting those patterns into pieces of fabric and sewing them together. 
Even the trail and error to adapt a pattern to my needs and all the different aspects that come into play in order to be successful. 
I'm not good at all of them, but I can do most of them well enough that I can go from something in my head to something that I can wear, that's practical.

## What do you hate the most about sewing?

I am bit too impatient to do large parts of hand sewing and that is not my most favorable part of sewing. 
I have done this before when I made my buttonholes by hand on my tailored jacket, 
but it takes too much time to give me any pleasure and it will most likely take a long time before I’ll do it again.

## What’s the hardest part of sewing to you?

It is nearly impossible for me to draw the mental picture that is in my head on a piece of paper. 
For this reason, I cannot -not even temporarily- put an end result of a certain clothing design on a piece of paper to look at it. 
Thus, I cannot get someone else’s opinion or input before I create it.

## What would be your advice for starting sewists/sewistas?

First of all, go for it and concentrate on the parts you like of it. 
And for the things you do not like so much, look at the bigger picture to find the reason that is motivating you to do it. 

Secondly, just keep going and don’t look at things that could discourage you. 
If something goes wrong, correct it while you're doing it again or focus on the smaller intermediate steps. 
It is important that you keep trying to do things, and not necessarily the same thing. 
It could be useful to make a different concept to get a new view on your previous obstacles. 

Lastly, don’t be intimidated by patterns, try different patterns, creators and techniques, and pick out what works for you. 
Enjoy the process of creating, not the product, that is the key of getting good at it. 
Eventually, you will get the garments you like.

## Are you married?

Not anymore, after 25 years I split up. I have a new partner now.

## Do you have children?

Five in total, two of myself and three of my partner.

## Are you a dog person or a cat person?

I am a dog person, but I don’t have a dog anymore.

## Do you have pets?

I had three dogs. I would enjoy having a dog, but my current life style and freedom to travel don't match up with having one.

## If there was one thing you could take with you to an uninhabited island what would it be? Why?

A knife, because it looks the most useful item to be able to cut stuff.

## If there was one person you could take with you to an uninhabited island, who would it be? Why?

Nobody, I could not forgive myself putting someone else through the same horror. 
I love what thousands of years of society has brought us, so I cannot pluck someone out of that luxury.

# Spotlight on some lesser-know FreeSewing features

Regardless of whether you've only recently discovered FreeSewing, or have been a user for many years, here are some things you might not have discovered on your own:

## Multilingualism

FreeSewing is available in 5 languages, each with their own website. In addition to English at freesewing.org, we have websites in [French](https://fr.freesewing.org/), [German](https://de.freesewing.org/), [Dutch](https://nl.freesewing.org/), and [Spanish](https://es.freesewing.org/).

If you'd like to help us add more languages, [get in touch](https://discord.freesewing.org/).
## Paperless patterns

Not a fan of printing and sticking pages together? Or perhaps you don't have a printer? Don't despair, because FreeSewing provides **paperless patterns**.

You'll find the **paperless** option under the **Pattern options**. Flick it on and now you'll have dimensions as well as a grid in either metric or imperial so you can transfer your pattern directly to fabric or another medium like pattern paper.

## Custom layout/tiler

Laying out the different pattern parts on your pattern happens automatically. But alas, it's one of those things that computers are far worse at that humans. Often you can save a bunch of pages by squishing things together yourself. If only you could, right?

Turns out you can. Simply **Export** your pattern as **SVG** and fire up **Inkscape** (which you can [download for free](https://inkscape.org/)). 

When you open the pattern in Inkscape, the entire pattern will be in a *group*, so first thing to do is to **select** it and **right-click** and choose **ungroup**. Now you can rotate and flip each part around and arrange them just as you like. When you're happy, click **File** -> **Document properties** and choose **Resize page to content**.

When you're done, save the SVG and upload it to our custom tiler: https://tiler.freesewing.org/
There you can upload the SVG and pick your page size, and you'll get a PDF just like on the  website. Only this time, with your own layout 👍

## Remove details from a pattern

This option was originally intended for laser cutters, but has other uses too.

For this, you'll have to enable so-called **Expert mode**. Under **Pattern options**, click **Expert mode** and set it to **Show**.
Now, you'll have the **Advanced** option under which you'll find **Detail**. If you set it to **Hide**, your pattern will not only show the outline of the different pattern parts.

This is also handy for when you are making doll clothes as the titles, logo, and size box end up being taking up more space than the pattern itself.

## Include only certain pattern parts

Since we've unlocked **Expert mode**, here's another tip you mightn't be aware of: the **Contents** option. This option allows you to not draft the entire pattern, but only those parts that you want. 

This can be handy if you want to make a change to a pattern and only print those parts that are affected. But also if you want to combine different styles. For example you can generate a complete Simon pattern, and then additional collar or cuff styles where only the collar/cuffs are included in the pattern.

Got an idea for some other cool feature you'd like to see? Make sure to [let us know](https://discord.freesewing.org/).

# Some of the more crazy ideas on our drawing board

We're rarely stuck for things to do, because some work is never finished: adding more patterns, writing more or better documentation, improving user experience, and so on.

But sometimes, we also like to shoot the breeze and come up with some ideas that are a bit off the beaten path. Here's a selection of them that we've been mulling over. Don't consider it a sneak preview though, some of these are bona fide moonshots:

## Allowing users to create their own pattern layouts on the site

The pattern layout -- the way the individual pattern pieces are laid out on the page -- seems like the low-hanging fruit of improvements. Almost without exception, your pattern will not be the most optimal layout.

Thing is, computers are not very good at this sort of spacial problem that's called *packing*. We could try to tweak the algorithm, but human beings are just intuitively better at it than computers are. 

**The goal**
To make it possible (and ideally easy) for people to do their own layout. So that before you export your pattern, you have the option to arrange it just as you like it.

**What it would take**
This is something that's been on the drawing board for quite some time. FreeSewing core already has support for custom layouts, so it's really *just* a matter of creating the frontend interface to handle the layouting.

**Roadblocks**
Doing the SVG layout on mobile is a minefield.

**Chances of this happening**
High. We're almost certainly going to do this at some point.

## Using 3D renders to showcase patterns or options

3D in general is something we have our eye on, but in this case it's really about presenting the patterns to the user. People want to know what they're going to get, and line drawings and showcases can only go so far to show that.

The idea would be to be able to show patterns on a 3D avatar. However, a big caveat is that we would have to be able to somehow automate this process since we can't go manually creating a 3D render of every pattern & option.

**The goal**
Create 3D renders of different patterns and the effect of pattern options. Integrating this with our build pipeline so those renders can be auto-generated.

**What it would take**
Some work has been done already. Last year we wrote a DXF-exporter plugin that can export patterns as DXF, a popular format in 3D tools. We did some initial tests with CLO3D but the lack of automation options not to mention the fact that it's a closed-source commercial product made us abandon that path.

The right thing to do would be using Blender so that this work would benefit the open source community.

**Roadblocks**
Blender is not that easy to learn. Automation and plugins in Blender need to be written in Python, and we're a JavaScript project. Basically, we have nobody who knows how to even start on this today.

**Chances of this happening**
Medium. Could really use some help on this.

## Frankenstein patterns

The name *Frankenstein pattern* is something that came up during one of our contributor calls, and the name sort of stuck. The idea is that you could mix and match parts from different patterns to create your own combinations. Like, pick a top and combine it with the sleeves from another top and perhaps the collar from yet another top.

**The goal**
Allow patterns to be created by combining different building blocks.

**Roadblocks**
This would require some sort of inter-pattern API or interface specification. 

**Chances of this happening**
Low. For pattern developers, combining parts from different patterns is already possible via inheritance. Exposing this sort of functionality to the user level would already be a significant challenge. But doing it in a way that requires no code and merely some clicking around is pretty far out there.

# FreeSewing is Brought to You By the Kindness of Strangers

On April 5th 2011, a Tuesday of all days, I published a sewing pattern on my blog. 
BXR-M01A was a pattern for boxer briefs that came in one size only, and was free to download under a Creative Commons license.

It was also the very first pattern I ever published.

The event as such doesn’t deserve much attention, but it just happens to have occurred 10 years ago — almost to the day. 
So it seemed a good starting point for a brief history of how we got from there to here.

## The Early Days

I started drafting my own sewing patterns because I had fitting issues with store-bought ones. 
Drafting my own patterns held the promise of flawless fit with just a bit of effort (Oh, how naive I was!). 
The fiddling about with paper had me bored in no time, so I set out to try to automate that part of the process. 
I came up with a way to reduce the pattern to a number of steps, and abstract away the measurements. 
Now, you could feed it whatever measurements you wanted, and it would re-draft the pattern for you.

I launched the beta version of my little pattern machine in February of 2012. 
It wasn’t an immediate success. 
As a matter of fact, to the best of my knowledge, only one person ever tested it. 
That person was Nico in Copenhagen (who I've sadly lost track of) who wrote:

> That is sooo cool.  
> I will enter my thoughts about your project using your feed back thingy on the pattern web site. 
> But you should know that the overall fit is amazing! I think I have a new favourite pattern :-)

## makemypattern.com

One good review is perhaps not much to go on, but I found it rather encouraging and set out to walk this path a bit further. 
Fast-forward six months and I’d rewritten the thing from scratch, and with four patterns available officially launched makemypattern.com in September of 2012.

Things sort of trickled along as I added a pattern every now and then. 
Then, in January 2014 I got an email from Tin Doan in Canada asking how they could donate to the site. 
I sort of expected this to be some sort of scam, but I still answered the email asking “Are you for real?”. Tin answered:

> Yes Joost, I'm serious. Please kindly accept $200.00 from me.

Sure enough, I soon found myself at the receiving end of a $200 donation. 
To this day, it remains the highest amount I've ever received in a single donation.

This unexpected yet very tangible token of support felt like a fork in the road. 
I'd been happy building this thing mostly as a learning experience. 
Now it felt like perhaps it needed a bit more devotion and care.

In retrospect, this point probably marks the end of my social life 😂 good thing I had found a partner by now (phew).

## Pivot to Open Source and freesewing.org

So of course I rewrote the whole thing — again — into what would turn out to be the last version of makemypattern.com. 
By the summer of 2016, five years after my first pattern release, and four years after launching makemypattern.com, 
my little hobby project had made a lot of headway, and I found myself at another turning point: 
Keep doing what I'm doing, or try to break through the next barrier.

Up until this point, I had been doing makemypattern.com on my own. 
The code wasn’t even available. I wanted to make it into an open source project that people could contribute to. 
But I had never started it with that ambition, and it was going to take some serious refactoring 
to make it into something that people would be able to wrap their heads around.

So I did exactly that, and in March 2017 I launched v1.0.0 of freesewing.org. 
A new name (and logo) to mark the transition to an open source project. 
This was a much more mature release, with a documented API and it led to the first patterns contributed by others. 
It also came with a hat I hadn't worn before, open source maintainer.

## FreeSewing v2.0.0: It's JavaScript Now

During all this time, the world of frontend development had changed and we could do so much more in a browser. 
Rather than picking a bunch of options and getting a pattern in the end, the idea of seeing 
the pattern update in your browser as you changed options was — at least in theory — attainable now. 

With that goal in mind, I started over again, this time in JavaScript. 
And in August of 2019 v2.0.0 landed on freesewing.org. 
A complete rewrite in JavaScript with a new website to boot.

Since then, I've been able to keep myself from rewriting the entire thing again 🤞

## The Family You Choose

We're getting closer to present time, but there's one more moment that stands out for me, 
and that's a blog post from August 2020 where — maybe for the first time — I explicitly asked for help to grow the project. 
Since then, a community has developed around FreeSewing that feels more valuable to me than any code I could ever write.

Motivation is a powerful thing, and I wonder whether FreeSewing would exist today if it wasn't for the full-on enthusiasm of Nico in the early days. 
Or whether it would have fizzled out without Tin injecting some rocket fuel in the form of a donation. 
Or whether perhaps I would have succumbed to burnout by now if I hadn't found such a great group of people to walk this road with me.

Speaking of which: There are countless individuals who have contributed to get to where we are today. 
I couldn't possible mention them all. But what they have in common is that at one point, they were complete strangers to me, as I was to them.

It’s the kindness of strangers that brought us here.

Thank you, Strangers.
