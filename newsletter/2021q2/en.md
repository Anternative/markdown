# FreeSewing is brought to you by the kindness of strangers

On April 5th 2011, a Tuesday of all days, I published a sewing pattern on my blog. BXR-M01A was a pattern for boxer briefs that came in 1 size only, and was free to download under a Creative Commons license.  
It was also the very first pattern I ever published.

The event as such does not deserve much attention, but it just so happens to have occured 10 years ago â€” almost to the day. So it seemed as a good starting point for a brief story of how we got from there to here.

## The early days

I started drafting my own patterns because I had fitting issues with store-bought sewing patterns. Drafting your own held the promise of flawless fit with  just a bit of effort (oh how naive I was).
The fiddling about with paper had me bored in no time, so at some point I set out to try to automate that process. I came up with a way to reduce the pattern to a number of steps, and abstract away the measurements. Now, you could feed it whatever measurements you wanted, and it would re-draft the pattern for you.

I launched the beta of my little pattern machine in February of the next year. It was not an immediate success. As a matter of fact, to the best of my knowledge, only one person ever tested it. That person was Nico in Kopenhagen (who I've sadly lost track of) who wrote:

> That is sooo cool. I will enter my thougts about your project using your feed back thingy on the pattern web site.
But you should know that the over all fit is amazing! I think I have a new favourite pattern :-)

## makemypattern.com

One good review is perhaps not much to go on, but I found it rather encouraging and set out to walk this path a bit further. Fast-forward 6 months and I had rewritten the thing from scratch, and with 4 patterns available officially launched makemypattern.com in September of 2012. 

Things sort of trickled along as I tried to add a pattern every now and then. Then, in January 2014 I got an email from Tin Doan in Canada asking how they could donate to the site. I sort of expected this to be some sort of scam, but I still answered the email asking *are you for real?*. Tin answered:

> Yes Joost, I'm serious. Please kindly accept $200.00 from me.

Sure enough, I soon found myself at the receiving end of a 200$ donation. To this day, it remains the highest amount I've ever received in a single payment.

This unexpected yet very tangible token of support felt like a fork in the road. I'd been happy building this thing mostly as a learning experience. Now it felt like perhaps it needed a bit more devotion and care. 

In retrospect, this point probably marks the end of my social life ðŸ˜‚ good thing I had found a partner by now (phew).

## Pivot to open source and freesewing.org
 
So of course I rewrote the whole thing â€” again â€” into what would turn out to be the last version of makemypattern. 
By the summer of 2016, 5 years after my first pattern release, and 4 years after launching makemypattern, my little hobby project had made a lot of headway, and I found myself at another turning point: Keep doing what I'm doing, or try to break through the next barrier.

Up until this point, I had been doing makemypattern.com on my own. The code was not even available. I wanted to make it into an open source project that people could contribute to. But I had never started it with that ambition, and it was going to take some serious refactoring to make it into something that people would be able to wrap their heads around.

So I did exactly that, and in March 2017 launched v1.0.0 of freesewing.org. A new name (and logo) to mark the transition to an open source project.  This was a much more mature release, with a documented API and it lead to the first patterns contributors by others. It also came with a hat I hadn't worn before, the one of open source maintainer.

## freesewing v2: It's JavaScript now

During all this time, the world of frontend development had changed and there was so much more we could do in a browser now. Rather than picking a bunch of options and getting a pattern in the end, the idea of seeing the pattern update in your browser as you changed options was â€” at least in theory â€” attainable now. 
With that goal in mind, I started over again, this time in JavaScript. And in August of 2019 v2.0.0 landed on freesewing.org. A complete rewrite in JavaScript with a new website to boot. 

Since then, I've been able to keep myself from rewriting the entire thing again ðŸ¤ž 

## The family you choose

We're getting closer to present time, but there's one more moment that stands out for me, and that's a blog post from August 2020 where â€” maybe for the first time â€” I explicitly asked for help to grow the project.
Since then, a community has developed around FreeSewing that feels more valuable than any code I could ever write.

Motivation is a powerful thing, and I wonder whether FreeSewing would exist today if it wasn't for the full-on enthusiasm of Nico in the early days. Or whether it would have fizzled out without Tin injecting some rocket fuel in the form of a donation. Or whether perhaps I would have succumbed under burnout by now if I hadn't found such a great group of people to walk this road with me.

Speaking of which; There are countless individuals who have contributed to get to where we are today. I couldn't possible try to mention them all. But what they all have in common is that at one point, they were complete strangers to me, as I was to them.

It is the kindness of strangers who brought us here. 

Thank you stranger.
