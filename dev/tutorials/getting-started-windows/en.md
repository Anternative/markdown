<Fixme>

This tutorial is not yet written. Sorry about that.

Part of the problem is that our main documentation contributors don't use Windows.  
If you have a Windows system, you could help us by writing up a guide like the ones
for [Linux](/tutorials/getting-started-linux/) and [Mac](/tutorials/getting-started-mac).
