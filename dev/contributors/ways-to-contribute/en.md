title: Ways to contribute
---

*Contributing* can take on many shapes and forms. 
There's certainly a way that works well for you.

<Note>

##### Onboarding the future open source contributors

Due to the nature of FreeSewing and our users, many of our first-time
contributors are taking their very first steps into the world of open source.

For this reason, the list below includes plenty of options for people with no
prior experience as an open source contributor.

If you're a more experienced contributor, you'll find some of the more
technical ways to contribute towards the bottom of the list.

</Note>


## Community building

The FreeSewing community is [on Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/). 
Just being there to answer questions and chat with other people is a valuable part of community building.

We also can be found [in plenty of other places](https://freesewing.org/community/where/) where we'd love to have you join us.

Maybe you can take on some responsibility on one of these platforms?

## Showcase our patterns

Anytime somebody has made one of our patterns, we like to showcase it on [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/showcase/).

Unpublished showcases are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 
Create an issue [in our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%91%8D+good+first+issue%2C+%F0%9F%93%B8+showcase%2C+%F0%9F%A4%97+community&template=showcase-template.md&title=Create+showcase+from+this+content) when you've made one of our patterns, or have came across pictures from another maker who did.

## Triage issues

Triaging issues is a great way to get involved FreeSewing. You can do tasks such as:

 - Making sure issues are properly labeled
 - Ensuring they have a good title that explains the issue in brief
 - Assigning issues to people to make sure they are tended to
 - Keeping an eye on stale issues, and either updating or closing them
 - Assigning issues to milestones so we can plan our releases

All FreeSewing contributors have triage permissions that allows them to do this.
If you don't have the rights, or bump into any issues, [reach out to us on Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org).

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 
Create an issue [in our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%90%9B+bug&template=bug-report.md&title=Bug+report) if you've found one.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. 
* **Include relevant information** such as your username on the site, or the person you draften a pattern for.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. it worked fine before but since the latest update it doesn't)
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

## Keeping track of todos

Not everything that needs to be done is a bug. Sometimes it's just a small improvement, or an enhancement.
Even if you don't know how to implement such a task, you can help out be [creating a GitHub issue for it](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new).  

This is helpful in more than one way:

 - It reduces the cognitive load of the people implementing changes because they don't have to worry about forgetting things
 - It increases transparancy by making it clear what sort of things are being worked on
 - It gives us that good feeling of closing the issue when the task is done

## Become a body ambassador

Maybe you’re unusually short or tall. 
Maybe you have a bit of a pot belly or very large breasts. 
Maybe you have a disability that requires fit adjustments. 

Whatever it is, if you represent a minority fitting issue you could 
represent this minority to make sure their needs are heard and understood.

## Become a language ambassador

You could represent FreeSewing in a non-English community. 
There, you can help answer questions or triage problem reports. 
Or you can point out where translations are missing.

## Become a pattern ambassador

You could take charge of a specific FreeSewing design/pattern. 

You’ll be the person to ask questions about how to make that pattern. 
You’ll make sure the documentation is not forgotten. 
And you can help with questions or triage problem reports to developers or designers.

## Proofreading

You could check the original English text of translations for typos and/or grammar mistakes.
You could propose improvements and watch over a consistent style and tone across FreeSewing’s documentation and written text.

## Technical writing (patterns)

You could write documentation for freesewing.org, our makers website.

You would need good writing skills and a familiarity with sewing.

## Technical writing (code)

You could write documentation for freesewing.dev, our developers website.

You would need good writing skills and a familiarity with code (Javascript).

## Translation

You could translate FreeSewing into one of its additional languages 
(French, German, Dutch, Spanish). Or if you’re ambitious, add a new one. 

## Make illustrations

Our documentation can always use some more/better illustrations to help people figure out how
to make our patterns into garments.

## Help with web/UI/UX design

You could help us make our website and tools pretty and improve the user experience.

## Desing sewing patterns

You could come up with new pattern designs for FreeSewing. 
We can help you with the development side of things.

## Develop sewing patterns

You could program new designs for FreeSewing. 
If you're not afraid of Javascript and are happy to team up with a designer, 
you could work on a new pattern together.

## Various other (technical) roles

In addition to this, we also could use help with backend development (NodeJS/Express),
database administration (MongoDB), devops, frontend developers (Gastby/React),
and system administration.

## Where to start

Unsure where to begin contributing to FreeSewing? 
You can start by looking through the issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%91%8D+good+first+issue%22).

Don't be afraid to take on an issue. If you get stuck, [we'll help you out](https://discord.freesewing.org/).
