title: 20|Building blocks

This illustration is a good starting point to gain a better understanding of the main FreeSewing building blocks:

<Example part="docs_overview" caption="A schematic overview of FreeSewing" />

As you learn more about FreeSewing, you'll discover that there's more to this picture than meets the eye. So let's get started.

## What you'll learn

FreeSewing is written in JavaScript. It is in other words, *made for the web*.

There's no shortage of resources that delve into frontend development and JavaScript. So here, your focus will be on how FreeSewing patterns work, and how you can create them yourself.

If we look at our image, it can can divided into three areas:

<Example part="docs_overview" caption="Your focus today is on the middle part" options={{focus: "Pattern"}} />

 - The left area with the *settings*  box
 - The middle area with the *Pattern* box and everything in it
 - The right area with the *draft* box and the *SVG* and *React* logos

As there's a lot going on in the middle *Pattern* box. Rather than get overwhelmed by trying to wrap your head around the entire thing, you will start with the basic building blocks. Let's get started.

<Note>

The left and right parts are all about how to integrate FreeSewing in your *frontend*.
In other words, how you'll plug it into your website, or online store, or a mobile
application.

That part is outside the scope of this text.
