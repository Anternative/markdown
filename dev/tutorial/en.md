Before we can get started, let's make sure you have the needed software on your machine:

## Prerequisites

FreeSewing is a JavaScript library, so the first thing you will need
is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
If you don't have Node.js on your system, follow the link above and 
install it on your system.

Then, continue to [Setting up the development environment](/tutorial/create-freesewing-pattern).
